Change log
==========

`Next version`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix a problem where newer Django versions would crash because of a
  missing ``inline_admin_formsets`` variable in the admin change form
  context.


`0.7`_ (2018-03-28)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Switched the image field from django-versatileimagefield_ to
  django-imagefield_. The latter uses the same database layout
  as the former, but there are differences when it comes to image
  generation and generating thumbnail URLs.


`0.6`_ (2018-03-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changed ``admin_details`` to not include superfluous ``<br>`` tags.
- Changed the ``accept_file`` methods on file mixins to return bools and
  not raise exceptions.
- Fixed the ``OverwriteMixin`` to call ``delete_files`` so that e.g.
  the ``imagefield`` gets a chance of removing stale
  thumbnails.
- Dropped the useless ``AbstractFile``, and renamed ``AbstractFileBase``
  to ``AbstractFile``.
- Added a guide on how to swap out the file model.
- Added a hint to the files changelist that drag-drop upload is
  possible.
- Disabled the drag-drop upload on the root folder (which would not have
  worked anyway, because files cannot be added to the root folder).
- Added ``unify`` so that only one quoting style is used in the code.
- Changed the order of ``accept_file`` methods called to the order of
  ``FILE_FIELDS`` instead of the MRO (resp. the classes where the file
  fields are defined initially).
- Fixed the double saves in ``OverwriteMixin``, and hopefully avoided
  edge case-y problems with ``delete_files``.


`0.5`_ (2018-03-13)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Made the folder CRUD functionality preserve query parameters so that
  ``raw_id_fields`` popups work seamlessly.
- Fixed the changelist to not crash when images are broken.
- Changed the admin fieldsets to only show fields related to one file
  type when a cabinet file is filled in already.
- Fixed a bug where adding subfolders would succeed, but redirect to the
  root folder.
- Added an admin action for moving multiple files at once to a different
  folder.


`0.4`_ (2017-07-04)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Made file model mixins determine themselves whether they can accept an
  upload or not.
- Refactoring and code cleanups.
- Tweaked the file list a bit.


`0.3`_ (2017-06-21)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added upload progress (only files, not bytes).
- Implemented cleaning of storage when deleting and replacing files.


`0.2`_ (2017-06-21)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Allow replacing files remotely.
- Added caption, copyright and alt text fields.
- Also show folder breadcrumbs when adding files.
- Drag-drop upload of files directly into the folder view.


`0.1`_ (2017-06-20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Initial public version.
